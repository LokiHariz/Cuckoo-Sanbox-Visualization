# Cuckoo-Sanbox-Visualization


This is a final year project modified cuckoo sandbox 2.0.7 using visualization graph which is integrated with "Visualize_Logs" python library.

What's has changed and makes it different to the original cuckoo sandbox?

* Added a new graph analysis tab for all analysis results (ransomware still in working)
* An interactive graph that can be moved, zoom in and out, and also filter processes and many more!
* Two graphs which are "Focused" (shwoing malware's processes and related to only) and "All Events"(All processes).
* Graphs can be exported as a html file and be transfered or give to anywhere for futher analysis.
